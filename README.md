# The Future of Front End

## About

Lunch time tech talk for colleagues on new front-end development
technologies.

Code samples not included as it will be an interactive talk based on
feedback and work-in-progress code.

### To view:

* ```git clone git://github.com/cmeiklejohn/future-of-front-end.git```
* ```bundle install```
* ```slidedown slides.md```

Note that, if bundler installs the pygmentize executable to a location other than /usr/local/bin/, you will need to set the PYGMENTIZE_BIN environment variable.

* ```export PYGMENTIZE_BIN="/Users/matt/.rbenv/versions/ree-1.8.7-2011.03/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/pygmentize-0.0.3/bin/pygmentize"```
